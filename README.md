## Google Colab Link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tsst8d46SMxuhaZANdB5dhb4hXdYvKyw?usp=sharing

### 1. What is the Fashion MNIST Dataset?

### 2. Why do we normalize image pixel values before training?

### 3. List the layers used in the neural network and their functions.

### 4. What does an epoch mean in model training?

### 5. Compare the predicted label and actual label for the first test image.

### 6. What could be done to improve the model’s accuracy?


# Task Enhancement:

### 1. Change the number of neurons in the hidden layer (e.g., 64 or 256) and retrain the model.

### 2. Increase the number of epochs and observe changes in accuracy.

### 3. Add another hidden layer and compare the results.
