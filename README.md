### 1. What is the Fashion MNIST Dataset?
The Fashion-MNIST dataset was created as a direct, more difficult drop-in substitute for the original handwritten digit MNIST dataset. It consists of 70,000 grayscale photos of ten different apparel categories. With 60,000 training photos and 10,000 test images, it was developed by Zalando Research and is frequently used for assessing machine learning systems.

### 2. Why do we normalize image pixel values before training?

### 3. List the layers used in the neural network and their functions.

### 4. What does an epoch mean in model training?

### 5. Compare the predicted label and actual label for the first test image.

### 6. What could be done to improve the model’s accuracy?


# Task Enhancement:

### 1. Change the number of neurons in the hidden layer (e.g., 64 or 256) and retrain the model.

### 2. Increase the number of epochs and observe changes in accuracy.

### 3. Add another hidden layer and compare the results.
